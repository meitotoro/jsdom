        <p>The spatial–temporal properties of aerosol types over China are studied using the radiance measure-
ments and inversions data at four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations in China. Based on a cluster analysis,
ﬁve aerosol classes were identiﬁed including a coarse-sized dominated aerosol type (presumably dust) and four ﬁne-
sized dominated aerosol types ranging from non-absorbing to highly absorbing ﬁne aerosols. The optical properties
and seasonal variations of these aerosol types are investi-gated. The results of analysis show that: (1) the highly
absorbing aerosols usually occur in winter, (2) non-absorbing aerosols are frequently observed in summer; (3)
coarse-sized dominated aerosols are frequently occurred in spring. </p>
